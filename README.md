# Jet brake mechanism model
This repository contains solution to AGH UST Modeling of dynamic systems course's exercise where I had to create an simulink model of 
aircraft carrier mechanism that could stop landing jet. Mechanical model is available in "simulink solution/brake_mechanism_simulink.pdf" sheet.
Inside this repository you can find two approaches to simulating the problem:
- simulation with bare Matlab code - "matlab solution"
- simulation via simulink model - "simulink solution"

## Goal
The goal of excercise was to use matlab/simulink to simulate real dynamic system which have to meet some conditions to work correctly.
By using built model we are able to pick mechanism parameters that provide complete jet stoppage while keeping jet pilot safe.
